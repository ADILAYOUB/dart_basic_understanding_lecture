//! Break and Continue
// While working on loops, we need to skip some elements or terminate
// the loop immediately without checking the condition.
// In such a situation, you can use the break and continue statement.

//! Break Statement
// Sometimes you will need to break out of the loop immediately
// without checking the condition.We use break statement.

// The break statement is used to exit a loop.
// It stops the loop immediately, and the programâ€™s control moves outside the loop.
// Here is syntax of break://! break;

// Example 1: Break In Dart For Loop
// Here, the loop condition is true until the value of i is less than or equal to 10.
// However, the break says to go outside the loop when the value of i becomes 5.

void exampleB1() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
      // loop stops when i == 5 because we used break at i == 5
      break;
    }
    print(i);
  }
}
// Example 2: Break In Dart Negative For Loop
// the loop condition is true until the value of i is more than or equal to 1.
// However, the break says to go outside the loop when the value of i becomes 7.

void exampleB2() {
  for (int i = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
    if (i == 7) {
      break;
    }
    print(i);
  }
}
// Example 3: Break In Dart While Loop
// this while loop condition is true until the value of i is less than or
// equal to 10. However, the break says to go outside the loop when the value of i becomes 5.

void exampleB3() {
  int i = 1;
  while (i <= 10) {
    print(i);
    if (i == 5) {
      break;
    }
    i++;
  }
}

// Example 4: Break In Switch Case
// As we already learn in dart switch case,
// it is important to add break keyword in switch statement.
// This example prints the month name based on the number of the month using a switch case.

void exampleB4() {
  var noOfMoneth = 5;
  switch (noOfMoneth) {
    case 1:
      print("Selected month is January.");
      break;
    case 2:
      print("Selected month is February.");
      break;
    case 3:
      print("Selected month is march.");
      break;
    case 4:
      print("Selected month is April.");
      break;
    case 5:
      print("Selected month is May.");
      break;
    case 6:
      print("Selected month is June.");
      break;
    case 7:
      print("Selected month is July.");
      break;
    case 8:
      print("Selected month is August.");
      break;
    case 9:
      print("Selected month is September.");
      break;
    case 10:
      print("Selected month is October.");
      break;
    case 11:
      print("Selected month is November.");
      break;
    case 12:
      print("Selected month is December.");
      break;
    default:
      print("Invalid month.");
      break;
  }
}

//! Continue Statement
// Sometimes you will need to skip an iteration for a specific condition.
// You can do this utilizing continue statement.

// The continue statement skips the current iteration of a loop.
// It will bypass the statement of the loop.
// It does not terminate the loop but rather continues with the next iteration.
//Here is the syntax of continue statement: //! continue;

// Example 1: Continue In Dart
// Here, the loop condition is true until the value of i is
// less than or equal to 10. However, the continue says to go
// to the next iteration of the loop when the value of i becomes 5.

void example1() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
      continue;
    }
    print(i);
  }
}

// Example 2: Continue In For Loop Dart
// Here, the loop condition is true until the value of i is
// more than or equal to 1. However, the continue says to go to the
// next iteration of the loop when the value of i becomes 4.

void example2() {
  for (int i = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
    if (i == 4) {
      continue;
    }
    print(i);
  }
}

// Example 3: Continue In Dart While Loop
// Here, this while loop condition is true until
// the value of i is less than or equal to 10.
// However, the continue says to go to the next iteration of the loop
// when the value of i becomes 5.

void example3() {
  int i = 1;
  while (i <= 10) {
    if (i == 5) {
      i++;
      continue;
    }
    print(i);
    i++;
  }
