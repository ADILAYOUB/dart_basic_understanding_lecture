//!  switch case to control your programâ€™s flow. A Switch case is used to
//!  execute the code block based on the condition.

/***
     switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        // statements
        break;
    case value2:
        // statements
        break;
    case value3:
        // statements
        break;
    default:
       // default statements
    }

    switch-case statement work in dart

    1. The expression is evaluated once and compared with each case value.
    2. If expression matches with case value1, the statements of case value1 are executed.
    3. If not same will happen to reset of the condition (cases) until match
    4. break keywords tell dart to exit the switch statement
    5. If there is no match, default statements are executed.

    //! We can use a Switch case as an alternative to the if-else-if condition.
