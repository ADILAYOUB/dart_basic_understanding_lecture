// In this section, you will learn the dart interface and how to implement an
// interface with the help of examples.
// In Dart, every class is implicit interface. Before learning about the
// interface in dart, you should have a basic understanding of the class
// and objects, inheritance and abstract class in Dart.

// Interface In Dart
// An interface defines a syntax that a class must follow.
// It is a contract that defines the capabilities of a class.
// It is used to achieve abstraction in the Dart programming language.
// When we implement an interface, you must implement all the properties
// and methods defined in the interface. Keyword implements is used to
// implement an interface.

// Syntax Of Interface In Dart
