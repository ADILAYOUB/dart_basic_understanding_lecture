//?  ASYNC AND AWAIT IN DART
// Async/await is a feature in Dart that allows us to write asynchronous code
// that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to read.

// When a function is marked async, it signifies that it will carry out some
// work that could take some time and will return a Future object that wraps
// the result of that work.

// The await keyword, on the other hand, allows you to delay the execution of an
// async function until the awaited Future has finished. This enables us to
// create code that appears to be synchronous but is actually asynchronous.

// The async and await keywords both provide a declarative way to define an
// asynchronous function and use their results. You can use the async keyword
// before a function body to make it asynchronous. You can use the await keyword
// to get the completed result of an asynchronous expression.

//? Important Concept

//To define an Asynchronous function, add async before the function body.
// The await keyword work only in the async function.
// Example: Synchronous function
void main() {
  print("Start");
  getData();
  print("End");
}

void getData() async {
  String data = await middleFunction();
  print(data);
}

Future<String> middleFunction() {
  return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 5), () => "Hello");
}

// We cannot perform an asynchronous operation from a synchronous function.

/*Important Terms
async The async keyword can be used before a functionâ€™s body to indicate that a
function is asynchronous.
async function Functions marked with the async keyword are known as async functions.
await The completed output of an asynchronous expression can be retrieved with
 the await keyword. Only async functions can use the await keyword.
